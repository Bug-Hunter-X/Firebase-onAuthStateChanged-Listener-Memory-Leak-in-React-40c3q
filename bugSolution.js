The corrected code addresses the memory leak by ensuring that the `unsubscribe` function is always called when the component unmounts:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { onAuthStateChanged } from 'firebase/auth';
import { auth } from './firebase'; // Your Firebase configuration

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
      // ... your logic based on the user
      // Ensure any state updates are handled appropriately when the user changes
    });
    return () => {
      unsubscribe(); // Always unsubscribe when the component unmounts
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    // ... your component JSX
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This ensures that the listener is always removed, preventing the memory leak.  Make sure to handle any asynchronous operations or cleanup tasks in the cleanup function to prevent additional issues.
